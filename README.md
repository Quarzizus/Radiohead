# radiohead-concert

Reserve ticket for radiohead concert

With this project I seek to practice the methods 
HTTP GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, as well as 
the hooks in react (useState, useEffect, useMemo). 
In view of the need for a own API, I decided to learn 
redux and context for dispense for it and 
I be able to deploy with travis and Github Pages.
